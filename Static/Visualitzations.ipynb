Even though in the previous graph we can compare the behaviour of the different stations, we thought that other charts were needed to successfully fullfil this objective.\n","\n","We thought that it could be interesting analyzing how the different selected stations work depending on the day and hour, regardless of the type of bike used. Despite this could be accomplished by an easy modfication of the former line chart (substituting the two charts by one with the total available bikes) this solution is not suitable for our needs. For example, if we want to compare how the station works at 2 PM depending on if it's Friday or Monday, two very far apart points should be compared, making the task of finding clusters difficult.\n","\n","For this reason, we thought that elaborating a heat map for each station could be the best solution.

We get to see how *Sants* and *FIB* highly differ in shape. In *FIB* the bikes arrive at around 7 AM when students start class and people go to work. These bikes are not taken until 10-11 AM when students start finishing their classes. For *Sants* we can see how the bikes arrive very early in the morning at around 4-5 AM, that's probably due to a worker refilling the station and they get rapidly taken, as people go to work. At around 2 PM there is a small peak due to people finishing working and then the people coming back home take those bikes. The low amount of bikes in *Sants* is explained because it is a crowded place and when there's an available bike there's also someone willing to take it.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q2: Do electrical bicycles behave the same as non-electrical ones?\n","We can answer this question by looking at the [first](#1) and [last](#5) visualizations. For the first one, we see that in *Sants* and *Sarrià* people mostly use mechanical bikes but at *FIB* people use the electrical ones. This can be explained since the *FIB* station is at a high altitude and students must pedal to the top so they prefer to use electrical bikes. Although *Sarrià* is also at a high altitude it corresponds to a residential zone and therefore people only take the bike when they leave home, which is downhill, but then come back using other methods. People use more mechanical bikes than electrical when the route is not uphill, in the other case they either use electrical or other methods.\n","\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q3: Does the station suffer from lack of bicycles?\n","To answer this question one can take a look at the [4th](#4) visualization. There we can see how the number of bikes per hour varies, in *FIB* and *Sarrià* there is a high amount of bikes early in the day but at the afternoon there are little to none bikes. In *Sants* we can see how most of the day the station is at a minimum level, with two peaks for the start of the morning (5 AM) and start of the afternoon (2 PM). \n","\n","To see it in a global perspective we can also take a look at the [overview](#1) or the [heat maps](#2), in both cases we see how in the student/residential zone for the weekend there are no bikes while in *Sants* (public transport zone) the number of bikes during the week stays pretty low (high demand) and remounts on Saturday and Sunday, when most people don't need to go to work and therefore the bikes are taken at a smaller rate. \n","\n","To take a more general look one could use the [3rd](#3)  visualization and therefore see that for *Sants* the average number of bikes available for the day during the working days is always 2 or 3, while for *FIB* and *Sarrià* there are from 5 to 7.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q4: Does the behaviour change according to the day of the week?\n","To answer this question we can use the [3rd](#3)  visualization, where we have a bar chart for each day of the week. We can see that *Sarrià* and *FIB* have a relatively high amount of bikes from Monday to Friday, with *FIB* having its maximum on Thursday and *Sarrià* on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then they get to around 1 over the weekend when people don't go to class or work. For *Sants* the behaviour is different, from Monday to Friday the amount of bikes stays pretty low, slowly growing throughout the week. For Saturday there is a large peak and on Sunday it halves. \n","\n","To go deeper we can use the [heat map](#2) to compare each whole day to another, where we can see the difference between Monday to Friday to Saturday and Sunday; or we can use the overview to also look for differences between the two bike types, where we can see how each type of bike (especially the predominant on for each station) behaves as we have seen for the bikes in general.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q5: What is the average available bicycles per day?\n","If we want to answer this question we can use the visualization [3](#3). There we can see the average number of available bikes per day for each station. As we have seen before, for *FIB* and *Sarrià* the average stays around 6 for the workable days and 1 during the weekend, while in *Sants* it is 2-3 during the week and 7 and 4 for Saturday and Sunday respectively.\n","\n","* *See [Annex](#a2)*.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q6: Does the behaviour change during the weekend?\n","As we have seen before in the questions Q4 and Q5, and using the visualizations [2](#2) and [3](#3), we can see two different behaviours in our stations. For *FIB* and *Sarrià* we see how during the weekend the number of bikes drastically drop to almost none. On the other hand, we see that *Sants* presents a different scenario where during the week the number of bikes is low but then increases for the weekend.\n","\n","Going deeper into every station we can explain the behaviours:\n","* The station *FIB* during the workable days are filled with the bikes from the students that go to class and then emptied when they leave. During the weekend they don't go to class and therefore they don't use the station.\n","\n","* For *Sarrià* during the workable days the residents take the bikes to go to work and then get back home using a different transport method as this station is at a high altitude. The bikes are filled early in the morning by the Bicing workers and the emptied when they leave to work. For the weekend as people won't use the bikes, the stations aren't filled by the company.\n","\n","* For *Sants* during the workable days there is a high demand of bicycles and therefore whenever one is available it is quickly taken. We can see two peaks in the early morning when the workers fill the station and another at the early afternoon when people leave work. All this movement during the week reduces the number of bikes available so on weekends we see a much higher number of bikes. During the weekend the workers likely take bikes from *Sants* to fill other stations, especially on Sunday.\n","\n","We can do the same comparations but looking into the types of bikes with visualization [5](#5). We can see how the bikes for *FIB* and *Sarrià* decrease on weekends and how they increase for *Sants* with the peak displaced to the right (later in the day). The types aren't affected differently by the weekend changes and we can see the dominant type for each station: *FIB* - Electrical and *Sarrià* & *Sants* - Mechanical.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q7: At what hours we are more likely to find bikes on working days?\n","We can answer this question using [4th](#4) visualization. In this chart, we can see the average number of bikes per hour for the workable days per station. The opacity highlights the larger values and we can easily see how the peaks are at *FIB*-9AM, *Sants*-5AM, *Sarrià*-3AM. The intervals where we are more likely to find a bike are:\n","* *FIB*: 7 AM-11 AM\n","* *Sants*: 5 AM & 14 AM (still low values)\n","* *Sarrià*: 1 AM-6 AM\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q8: Does a docking station in a residential area behave like a station located in a non-residential one?\n","To answer this question we can take a look at the [heat map](#2). There we can see how in *Sarrià* the bikes are taken early in the morning when people leave home, and then we should expect them to come back but as this station is uphill, people prefer to use other transport methods. In the other two stations, the bikes follow distributions according to the patterns of the people usage of the facilities: In *FIB* there are bikes while there are students and in *Sants* more dynamic traffic is seen. To see the distribution more clear we can use the fourth visualization, where we see how the peak in *Sarrià* is earlier than in *FIB*, as residents would take the bikes to go to work/study (to places like *FIB*) and therefore they move the bikes from their residential area station to student/work areas.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","####Q9: What type of bike do the users prefer?\n","Using the [last](#5) visualization we can see how the usage of the different type of bikes goes. For each station there is a different behaviour:\n","* In *FIB* we can see how both mechanical and electrical fill up at the same time but the mechanical ones are emptied first, although there's a smaller amount.\n","* In *Sants* the number of bikes is pretty low and we see no preference for the users, as there are not many bikes, any option is good.\n","* In *Sarrià* we can see a similar behaviour than in *FIB*. For the peak in the morning, we see how the mechanical bikes are taken before the electrical ones.\n","\n","This can be explained because:\n","1. Using an electrical bike is more expensive than a mechanical one (users have to pay an extra fee).\n","2. Bicing workers seem to refill more mechanical bikes than electrical bikes (we can see it at the peak on visualization [4](#4) for *Sarrià*).\n","3. The benefits of having an electrical bike vanish when a downhill route is made, like leaving *Sarrià* or *FIB*, so the extra fee isn't worth it.\n","\n","Overall users prefer mechanical bikes but in some specific cases (like in the *FIB*: uphill, not many alternatives) they prefer electrical ones."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b5FZFY8YWTYE"},"source":["---\n","##**ANNEX**\n","<a name=\"a1\"></a>\n","####**A.1**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":429,"output_embedded_package_id":"1GcY5yESNSZAQ833s6pSfH-WUSjYFtyzb"},"id":"CYOuB_nYWvYm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606152560356,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":30231,"user":{"displayName":"Victor NM","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgORekACBLSKk6x_avdazpPxGwL5RHjqqdX97hxQQ=s64","userId":"04153748842328864873"}},"outputId":"2ff2f23c-f816-447b-e39a-7683ab00eba1"},"source":["alt.Chart(overview_melt).mark_line().transform_timeunit(\n","    datetime_day = \"day(last_reported)\"\n",").transform_calculate(\n","    day_number = \"day(datum.last_reported)\", \n","    day_name = \"split(datum.datetime_day,' ')[0]\",\n","    day_hour = \"(datum.day_name) + ' ' + hours(datum.last_reported) + ':00'\",\n",").encode(\n","     alt.X('day_hour:O', sort=alt.SortField(field=\"day_number\"),title = 'Hour-Day'),\n","     alt.Y('average(Available bikes):Q',title = 'Average available bikes'),\n","     order=\"day_number:Q\",\n","     color=alt.Color('station:N', legend=alt.Legend(title=\"Station\"),scale = alt.Scale(scheme= 'set2')),\n","     strokeDash='type:N'\n",").properties(width = 1000, title='Overview')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Yf4qcezCX6Ug"},"source":["<a name=\"a2\"></a>\n","####**A.2**\n","This question was reformuled. \n","\n","The original was: *What is the average of bicycles taken per day?*\n","\n","After talking to the coordinator of this project we find convinient to clarify the aim of the question.
