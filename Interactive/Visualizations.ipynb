We can see the number of bikes encoded with colour. The ones with more bikes are: *Sant Martí*, *Ciutat Vella* and *Sant Andreu*, in this order.\n","####Q1.1: Which is the district with more mechanical bikes?\n","Still in the [overview](#1) we have the possibility to specify between mechanical, electrical or both types. With this interaction, we can answer the same question but looking just at the mechanical bikes. The districts with more mechanical bikes are: *Ciutat Vella*, *Sant Martí* and *Sant Andreu. The values for mechanical are very similar to the ones for both types.\n","####Q1.2: Which is the district with more electrical bikes?\n","As we did earlier we can now specify the bikes for the electrical type. The districts with more electrical bikes are: *Horta-Guinardó*, *Nou Barris* and *Les Corts*. *Horta-Guinardó* has a value of 1.7, which is almost two times higher than the other ones. This is because this district is located in an uneven altitude zone with most of the district being uphill (w.r.t the neighbour districts), and therefore people tend to use more e-bikes. \n","\n","&nbsp;\n","###Q2: Does electrical and mechanical bike availability correlate?\n","In order to answer this question we can use the [scatter plots](#3). The number of electrical and mechanical bikes are encoded in the X and Y- axis. If we fix a district through selection we can see how the bike availability behaves for each weekday. Now we can see how both types of bikes correlate. There are two behaviours present in the data:\n","* One corresponds to the districts that have a small amount of e-bike range and a wide distribution for the mechanical bikes. In this group we can fit the districts: *Sant Martí*, *Sant Andreu*, *Sants-Montjuïc*, *Eixample* and *Ciutat Vella*.\n","* The other group are districts with less active stations, where both values form a cloud of points. In this group we can fit *Gràcia*, *Horta-Guinardó*, *Les Corts*, *Nou Barris*, *Sarrià-Sant Gervasi*.\n","\n","Another way to see it could be via the [bubble chart](#2). If we want to focus on the evolution during the month rather than on the stations in the district we will need to use this visualization.\n","\n","If we look at the chart we can see how the cloud of points of each district once the month is over (selecting day 31) has a positive slope. In some cases it is very small, in others it is more accentuated. The only district with a strange behaviour is *Sant Andreu* where the cloud of points seems to have a negative but small slope.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","###Q3: How does the activity evolve along weekdays or weekends of a month per each district?\n","We can answer this question in two ways: \n","\n","&nbsp;  1 - We could use the [bubble chart](#2) to plot the evolution of each district. The bubble chart encodes both types of bikes and the total and has the possibility to interact with it. There are two possible interactions: with one we can select the districts we want to focus on; with the other, we can select the day of the month and see the evolution up to that day. We can see the variation during the month for each district.\n","And if we were to see this evolution per weekday we can take a look at the [scatter plots](#3). Here we can use the interaction of district selection with the weekdays already split.\n","\n","&nbsp; 2 - If we want to see the evolution in a more continuous way we can use the [heatmap](#E2) and [line chart](#E3). With the line chart we can see the evolution for both types of bikes, for the selected district with a tooltip that specifies both values. And with the heatmap we have the possibility to see the evolution both through the month (day1 -> day2 -> day3) and weekday (monday1 -> monday2 -> monday3).\n","\n","We can see how, in general, the number of bikes is similar during the month with the minimum values appearing at the weekends. The trend is the same for electrical and mechanical but the decrease during the weekends is higher in the mechanicals as there are more of them during the week.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","###Q4: Do neighbouring districts behave similarly?\n","To answer this question one might look at two traits. One option is to compare the evolution of both districts and another one is to compare the average values for the month.\n","\n","To compare this we need to select the neighbouring districts in the [overview](#1) map and then, using the [bubble chart](#2), we can compare the evolution and values of them. By doing this we can see that the neighbour districts are correlated mostly in pairs and not with all of them. For example, *Nou Barris* is neighbour to *Horta-Guinardó* and *Sant Andreu* but the behaviour of the first two is similar while the third one is way different. Other examples of correlated pairs are: *Les Corts* and *Sarrià Sant-Gervasi*, *Ciutat Vella* and *Sant Martí*, *Sants-Montjuïc* and *Eixample*.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","###Q5: How are bikes distributed among districts? And in the whole city?\n","To answer this question we will use the [histogram](#4). With the selection provided by the map or the interactive legend we can specify which districts we want to analyze. We can see the distributions for each district, groups of districts and the whole city. If we take a look at these histograms we can see that:\n"," * The distributions vary a lot depending on the district.\n"," * All districts have stations with very low usage\n"," * The city has a big number of low usage stations\n"," * The average value is around 10.\n","\n","If we now also use the bike type interaction we can see that:\n"," * The mechanical bikes behave just like the total (proof that they are the majority of bikes used)\n"," * The e-bike distribution is accumulated at low values.\n"," * The higher e-bike values are between 3 and 5, while for mechanical it is between 30 and 35.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","###Q6: Does the behaviour change according to the day of the week?\n","To answer this question we can use the [heatmap](#E2). In the heatmap we have a calendar-shaped visualization of the number of bikes for each district. With a district selected we can see the number of bikes per day of the month. We can see how evolution depends on the district. \n","* Some of them decrease: *Les Corts*, *Sarrià Sant-Gervasi*, *Gràcia*.\n","* Some others do not experience much change: *Eixample*, *Sant Martí*, *Horta-Guinardó*.\n","* And others increase: *Nou Barris*, *Sants-Montjuïc*, *Sant Andreu*, *Ciutat Vella*.\n","\n","Another way to approach this question is by using the [scatter plots](#3), we can now compare the values between districts and stations of the same district of the working days. With the scatter plot we lose the possibility to compare w.r.t day of the month but we can see a more detailed depiction of the behaviour during the week.\n","\n","We can see how the values are close to zero (especially in the e-bike) and as the week goes on some of the points tend to grow (Monday to Tuesday) and then decrease at the end of the week (Thursday to Friday)."]}]}
